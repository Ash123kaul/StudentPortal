🚩 Problem Statement

Traditional academic monitoring happens too late. Students with low attendance, poor grades, or unpaid fees are only identified at the end of the term—by then it's hard to help them. There is no system that alerts students early or informs parents before it becomes serious.

✅ Our Solution

We developed a web-based student dashboard platform that provides:

Real-time academic progress tracking

Automated alerts for low attendance, bad grades & fee dues

Counseling support via chatbot

Parental notifications via SMS

Secure student login using Firebase authentication and database

🧑‍💻 Key Features
🔹 1. Student Login System

Students can log in with email & password.
We created demo login accounts:

rahul@gmail.com — Pass: 123456

priya@gmail.com — Pass: 123456

amit@gmail.com — Pass: 123456

Once logged in, the student is redirected to their personalized dashboard.

🔹 2. Dashboard Page

Students can view:

Attendance percentage

Assessment scores / grades

Fee payment status

Recent alerts about their performance

🔹 3. Profile Page

Shows personal and academic info fetched from Firebase Realtime Database.

🔹 4. Alert System (Main Highlight)

The system monitors:

Short attendance

Low grades

Pending fees

✅ If 1 alert exists, an SMS is automatically sent to the student’s mobile number.
✅ If the student has 2 or more alerts, an SMS is sent to the parent’s mobile number.
This helps in early intervention and avoids academic dropouts.

🔹 5. Help Page with AI Chatbot

A built-in chatbot helps students by answering their queries about:

Attendance

Fees

Exam schedule

Academics

🔹 6. Payment Page

Students can view and manage their fee payment status or pending dues.
